# READ ME
Hey you!
This is the development of our first font. I decided to put this on GitHub because I wanted to see how this works and if it could mean something to our team in the future.
Lookin' good so far! ;)

I have to appoligize for my english in advance. My native language is Dutch (Nederlands). I have a good grade for english at school so I should be fine.

Development of this font is going to take some time. I didn't even pinpoint a name yet (0)_(0). So patience is a virtue here.

Thanks for reading this text! You're awesome! Really. But you should get a hobby. Or maybe your hobby is reading read-me's. In that case, look at you go! I'm proud of you! :)
